# GD-Custom-Patcher
Customize hard coded colors in Geometry Dash to your liking

This Program lets you easily customize hard coded colors in Geometry Dash. You can either launch it in GUI mode or as CLI using command line arguments.

Feel free to include this with your texturepack for a cleaner UI look.

As you have likely noticed this is made in AHK.
I know that its an unusual language for anything that has this sort of purpose.
I originally wanted to make something similar in C# but then realized I hate making GUIs.
Then I went on to embed the common language runtime inside an AHK script that houses the GUI and then have the other functionality in C#.
I don't really know what happened next but I decided to just remake the entire thing in AHK.

<b>Other Colors im looking for:</b>

There are a few colors that I would like to include in the custom patcher.
As this is not really a mod for Geometry Dash but rather a Patcher that directly edits GD's hex instructions, the memory address of a color is sadly not useful to me.
That means I need the byte offsets for the RGB values INSIDE GeometryDash.exe.
If you know of any offsets for any of the following colors please contact me on Discord by adding me (Ikszyon#9500) or literally any other means.
Credit will of course be given.
